Hi! I am Pulock Deb Roy, We are excited to present our project from the Database Management System (CSE-3114) Sessional course! Working with my talented teammates—Fabliha Zafar Prima, Delwar Hussin Sagor, and Suborna Deb—we developed a cutting-edge Medical Management System designed to streamline healthcare operations and improve service delivery.
